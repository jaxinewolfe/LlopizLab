# LlopizLab

Project: NES-LTER 
Goal: Producing a reproducible workflow for analysis of diet data from LTER cruises

Use Cases:
R script for utilization of single sheet long format for data entry (complimentary to subsequent workflows)
Workflow for data visualization: Relative abundance prey types per cruise
- Side project: ITIS namespace validation resolving Llopiz lab and NOAA (EcoMon and) diet taxa classifications
Workflow for data visualization: CCA per cruise (building on Suca et al. 2018)
- (Metadata tables and) workflow for data package for 2013-2015 data in Suca et al. 2018
Workflow for the prey size data per cruise: Calculate median length (mm) per prey type using appropriate length-to-biomass conversions
