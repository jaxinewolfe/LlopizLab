# LlopizLab

This branch contains Jaxine's Partnership Education Program project. Over the summer of 2019, she worked in collaboration with the Northeast Shelf Long Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) group and the Llopiz lab at Wood's Hole Oceanographic Institution. The overarching goal of her research was to produce a reproducible workflow for analysis of diet data from NES-LTER cruises.

Project Collaborators: Justin Suca, Joel Llopiz, Stace Beaulieu, Jaxine Wolfe

### Project Components
**Abundance:** This project generates visualization of the relative abundance of prey types per cruise and fish species.
*ITIS Taxonomic Validation:* This project resolves and validates prey species classifications and assigns categorical bins of prey type. 
**CCA:** This project conducts a canonical correspondence analysis for distinct fish species across multiple cruises.
**EML Assembly:** This project assembles metadata tables for fish diet data from 2013-2015 (Suca et al. 2018) and constructs an EML assembly line for the packaging and publishing of LTER data to the EDI repository.
